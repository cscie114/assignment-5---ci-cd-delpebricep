This game was a childhood classic of mine- one of the first video games I ever owned. I was a big fan of the Looney Tunes cartoons when I was a young child, especially that "wascally wabbit" so I had to have this.

Childhood bias need not apply here. I recently played the game as an adult and to my surprise, it still holds up. There are a few dated gameplay elements here and there and the collision dectection was a bit clunky. However, it was not enough to hamper the whole experience- what with its puzzle-solving and excellent humor in the spirit of the classic Warner Bros. cartoons. This game was fun, warts and all.
